Building FAST {#building-fast}
===============================

To setup and build the framework, see the instructions for your operating system:
- [Linux (Ubuntu)](@ref building-on-linux)
- [Windows](@ref building-on-windows)
- [Mac OS X](@ref building-on-mac) Note: Mac OS X version is unstable and not actively maintained anymore due to Apple's decision to stop supporting OpenCL and OpenGL.
